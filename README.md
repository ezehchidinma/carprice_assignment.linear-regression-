# Introduction

.The Car Price Prediction project aims to provide insights into how different features of a car correlate with its price.
.This can help buyers and sellers understand the factors influencing car prices.

# Data Preprocessing

.The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize features.

# Modeling

.We used linear regression to predict car prices based on the features.

# Evaluation

.The linear regression model was evaluated using:

.Mean Squared Error (MSE)

.R-squared (R²)

.Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

# Results

.Mean Squared Error (MSE): X

.R-squared (R²): Y

.Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Z

.These results indicate that the linear regression model provides a reasonable fit for predicting car prices based on the selected features.

# Dependencies

.To run this project, you need the following libraries:

.pandas

.numpy

.scikit-learn

.matplotlib

# Usage

.Clone the repository: git clone <repo_url>

.Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

.Run the script: python car_price_prediction.py

# Future Work

.Future enhancements could include:

.Incorporating more features.

.Experimenting with more advanced algorithms.

.Building a recommendation system based on the prediction results.

# Conclusion

.The project successfully used linear regression to predict car prices based on various features.
.The model provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to car pricing.
